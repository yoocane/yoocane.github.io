Hi üëã. I am currently a Postdoc Researcher at the Graduate Aerospace Laboratories of the California Institute of Technology ([GALCIT](https://galcit.caltech.edu/)), working with Prof. [Soon-Jo Chung](https://galcit.caltech.edu/people/sjchung) and Prof. [Yisong Yue](http://www.yisongyue.com/). I am also affiliated with the Center for Autonomous Systems and Technologies ([CAST](http://cast.caltech.edu/)) at Caltech. I was named a [Rising Star in Data Science](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/rising-stars/#rising-stars-profiles-2) by the University of Chicago in 2022.

‚è≥ I have completed my Ph.D. in Robotics in 2022 from the [Robotics Institute](https://robotics.umich.edu/) at the University of Michigan (UM), advised by Prof. [Ryan Eustice](http://robots.engin.umich.edu/~ryan/), Prof. [Jessy Grizzle](https://ece.umich.edu/faculty/grizzle/) and Prof. [Maani Ghaffari](https://curly.engin.umich.edu/people#h.7jd25w55csv). I worked as a member of the Perceptual Robotics Laboratory ([PeRL](http://robots.engin.umich.edu/)), the Computational Autonomy and Robotics Laboratory ([CURLY](https://curly.engin.umich.edu/)), and the [Bipedal Robotics lab](https://www.biped.solutions/) at UM.

üî≠ I am broadly interested in Robotics, Computer Vision and Machine Learning. Specifically, my research focuses on perception and navigation for robot autonomy.
