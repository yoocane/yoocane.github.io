Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm Yao Chen, and I'm currently a third-year Ph.D. student (Sep.2020 -) at the [Robot Mobility & Manipulation (ROMA) Lab](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/) of [SUSTech](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/), shenzhen, China, working with Prof.[Zhenzhong Jia](https://mee.sustech.edu.cn/2019/jiaoshou4_0930/842.html).

I finished my Masters degree (Sep.2017 - Dec. 2019) in Robotics at Harbin Institute Of Technology, ShenZhen ([HITSZ](http://en.hitsz.edu.cn/)), supervised by Prof. [Wenfu Xu](http://faculty.hitsz.edu.cn/xuwenfu).
Prior that, I obtained a B.Eng (Sep.2013 - Jun. 2017) from Harbin Institute Of Technolog, Harbin ([HIT](http://www.hit.edu.cn/)), also studying Robotics.
