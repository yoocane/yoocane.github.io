I was a Graduate Student Instructor for the graduate-level course **NA 568/EECS 568/ROB 530 Mobile Robotics: Methods & Algorithms (Winter 2018)** held at the University of Michigan, taught by [Prof. Maani Ghaffari](https://robotics.umich.edu/profile/maani-ghaffari/). Topics include Bayesian filtering; stochastic representations of the environment; motion and sensor models for mobile robots; algorithms for mapping, localization; application to autonomous marine, ground, and air vehicles.
