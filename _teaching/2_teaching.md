I was one of the course developers for a new undergraduate-level robotics course **ROB 101: Computational Linear Algebra (Fall 2020)** at the University of Michigan, taught by [Prof. Jessy Grizzle](https://ece.umich.edu/faculty/grizzle/). The course was has been awarded [Provost's Teaching Innovation Prize](https://ece.engin.umich.edu/stories/provosts-teaching-innovation-prize-for-new-robotics-course-that-focuses-on-equitable-education) and highlighted on [The University Record](https://record.umich.edu/articles/six-projects-to-be-awarded-provosts-teaching-innovation-prizes/) in 2021 for focusing on equitable eduation.

I was a Graduate Student Instructor for the undergraduate-level course **ROB 101: Computational Linear Algebra (Fall 2021)** held at the University of Michigan, taught by [Prof. Jessy Grizzle](https://ece.umich.edu/faculty/grizzle/). I have developed lab materials and hosted lab sessions for this course.
